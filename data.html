<p>This page is currently is an early stage of development. Eventually, it will store a variety of graphs and written information which will compliment the graph shown on the defult page of the website. This page will features objects like graphs of the virus's spread specific to different countries as well as the world, and will feature options to display deaths, ongoing cases, and recovories. While this page will not be quite as essential as the world map on the home page, it will provide a wealth of data to anyone looking to find some specific statistics.
